# Wallaby
Wallaby is a recipe finding app that allows people to search a food, like chicken, and then a bunch of recipe's involving chicken will show up. This was a project made with HTML, CSS, Bulma, and JavaScript using two API's and making them co-exist together beautifully...This was also a project for U of O Coding Bootcamp.

## Project 1 Overview
"Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests." - Someone who wrote the fullstack bootcamp instructions


## Application Requiremnts:
* Must use at least two server-side APIs
* Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
* Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
* Use at least one new third-party API
* Must have a polished UI
* Must meet good quality coding standards
* Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts (look into modals)
* Must be deployed to GitHub Pages

## The Two API's
* [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/) - A Nutrition and Exercise API
* [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) - An API to get meals and recipes

# Concept
**Given** I am user who wants to find recipes
**When** I enter the name of a dish and click the search button
**Then** I am presented with a list of recipes

**Given** I am a user who views a list of recipes
**When** I click on one recipe
**Then** I am presented with the selected recipe

**Given** I am a user who wants to prepare a recipe
**When** I view a recipe
**Then** I also view ingredients for that recipe

**Given** I am a user who wants information about nutrition
**When** I view ingredients for a recipe
**Then** I am presented with nutrition facts for these ingredients

## The Creators:
* **Corey** - Also known as Merlin. An absolute wizard. A complete mastery in the dark arts of coding. Choosing to use his knowledge for good in the battle of the dark arts of coding.
* **Max** - The Young Prodigy. The natural talent is very strong with this man. The council has spoken and is honestly kind of scared of what his power could turn into. 
**Ian** - The Lost Child. Displays signs of great potential. Then displays signs of complete and absolute incompetence. Overall good person though. With the proper training, he could become a very useful ally in the battle of coding

### Challenges:
Had to change ideas because of bad API's. Originally going to be an app for WalMart or Amazon

### Successes:
Worked as a team and had fun. At least I did.

## Overall
I beleive we made a really good app for a two week project. The functionality is there and you can find what you are looking for. There is also a lot of room for future development.
